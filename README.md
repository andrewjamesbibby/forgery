## About The Project

When dealing with multiple servers on a daily basis it is important to have all information available when required.

Forgery makes it simple to manage all aspects of Forge server and site management. Forgery makes use of the Forge API to build up requests and display responses quickly and easily.

All user input is gathered via interactive menus which means no need to remember any command line flags or know which parameters an api call requires. Simply navigate around using the menus and inputs.

Note: Forgery has been developed and tested on Mac OS only. Please report an issue if there are any problems on other platforms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This tool requires that Node.js and NPM are both installed. Instructions to install can be found at [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation

1/ Install globally: 
```
npm install -g @andrewjamesbibby/forgery
```

2/ Open Forger anywhere:
```
forger
```

3/ Navigate to 'Settings' and enter Forge API key when prompted

**Note: The API Key will be stored at ~/.config/configstore/forger.json so ensure to remove this file if Forger is uninstalled and no longer required**
